# PreLinks - cached even before clicked!

This simple plugin will load and cache pages right when the user shows a mere intention to visit a link (move the cursor upon the link).

That results in a very quick navigating among pages, lower load, and great user experience.

## Usage

Put the script to the bottom of `<body>` into each HTML page:

```html
<script src="../src/index.js" type="module" id="prelinks"></script>
```

That's all!
